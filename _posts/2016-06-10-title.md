Many people like to make this "after one year of [insert achievement here]" and that's pretty cool, this execise is paramount for yourself to drop a couple of thoughts on paper and fix new goals for the next iteration to come.

I decided to be original and to make a "after one year and a half of [insert achievement here]" kind of post. You don't see this one that much, gigity.

## Boot-stra-ping
As a young french developer, I've always had a pretty important focus on code and its many applications. From the languages themselves to the final interaction of the user on your na√Øve interface. Working for companies that had no vision quickly became something really hard to manage.

I've always had a problem with medium sized company (200/400 employees) calling themselves "startups" while at the same time being as fat, stupid and shy as a huge mondial company. I remember people that achieved great things out of too much luck and too awesome partners being sucked by these medium-sized companies and creating kind of chaos of immobility in there.

My goal is not to create a huge VC-funded startup that will end up like that.

What we've built, me and my partner, with Blaaast was first of all a **system of values**.

## Kickstarting Blaaast
Sofian (my partner) and I are friends since primary school and our biggest challenge when we decided to build a company together was to keep our friendship safe. I heard too many stories of friends creating companies together and exploding from the inside.

We had 6 months before I could leave my job and we used that time to create the framework that is today handling blaaast internals. From our engagement in terms of working time/hours, to the way we interact with clients or the different escape plan we have in case of a problem between the two of us. And by escape plan, I mean "if something goes wrong between us, we MUST go on a week-end together and work things out". I think this was one of the cornerstone of our "problem-free year and half".

### From developer to entrepreneur
One of my engagement for Blaaast was to be a good guy developer and release projects on time. But I didn't wanted to do project management, I didn't wanted to do the company's management and overall I didn't wanted to talk to client too much. I mean that's a CEO job right ?

Which sounds quite fun when I look back now.

Two weeks before we even created the company, we had our first contract : a cool single-page application built to help social entrepreneurs participate to a "Tour de France" that takes place in early september. It is still online : (https://apply.ticketforchange.org)[https://apply.ticketforchange.org].

The business definitely kicked-in immediately and we had to be strong and close together to handle it all.

Which led to our first "partners meeting".
