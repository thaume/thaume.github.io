I started my career at Viad√©o, designing software architectures enabling developers to iterate on their ideas and test new services faster. Two years later, my drive to have a more significant impact led me to create Blaaast, an agency dedicated to empowering employees of large french companies by co-creating meaningful mobile applications.

My latest company, metriq, leverages the power of design methodologies, data collection and machine learning to build or enhance products and processes that provide recommendations, prediction and automation.

This is my personal blog. I write here to engage with the developer community.
