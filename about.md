I work as a front-end architect at viadeo in Paris.

My job was to create a new NodeJS stack for our middle-end, now that it is done I spend my time helping developers get the best from this new platform.

This is my personal blog. I write here, mostly about front-end stuffs, to engage with the developer community.
