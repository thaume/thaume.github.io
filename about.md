I work as a front-end architect at viadeo in Paris where my initial mission (starting mid-2013) was to create a new NodeJS stack for our middle-end. This project being finished, I now focus on engineers training and fine tuning of the new NodeJS framework.

I also built the pipeline of Ember.js app creation (pre-EmberCLI). I now spend my time training engineers on this technology and finding the best way to solve our front-end issues.

This is my personal blog. I write here, mostly about front-end stuffs, to engage with the developer community.
