I work as a front-end architect at viadeo in Paris where my initial mission (starting mid-2013) was to create a new NodeJS stack for our middle-end. This project being done, I now focus on engineers training and fine tuning of the new NodeJS framework.

This is my personal blog. I write here, mostly about front-end stuffs, to engage with the developer community.
